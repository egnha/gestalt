\title{gestalt: Tools for Making and Combining Functions}
\description{
Provides a suite of function-building tools centered around a
(forward) composition operator, %>>>%, which extends the semantics of the
magrittr %>% operator and supports tidyverse-style quasiquotation. It enables
you to construct composite functions that can be inspected and transformed as
list-like objects. In conjunction with %>>>%, a compact function constructor,
fn(), and a function that performs partial application, partial(), are also
provided. Both support quasiquotation.
