# nofrills

## 0.2.1

  * Tests are now compatible with testthat 2.0.0.

  * Alias `..()` is removed.

## 0.2.0

  * `fn()` now comprehends literal unquoting operators via the use of `QUQ()`,
    `QUQS()` and `QUQE()`. This allows you to make functions with `fn()` that
    contain unquoting operators, which is handy when programming with dplyr or
    other tidyverse packages.

  * `make_fn_aware()` is a new functional operator that enhances a function by
    enabling it to interpret abbreviated functional arguments (cf. `as_fn()`).

  * In order to keep the package namespace slim, `..()` has been softly
    deprecated.

## 0.1.0

  * Initial release
