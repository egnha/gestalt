## Overview

_nofrills_ is a lightweight R package that provides `fn()`, a more powerful 
variation of `function()` that:

  - **costs less** — enables Tidyverse
    [quasiquotation](http://rlang.tidyverse.org/reference/quasiquotation.html)
    so you don’t pay the price of
    [functional impurity](#whats-the-point-of-quasiquotation)
    
  - has the **same great taste** — supports a superset of `function()`’s syntax
    and capabilities
    
  - is **less filling** —
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    fn(x, y = 1 ~ x + y)
    
    ..(x, y = 1 ~ x + y)
    ```
    are both equivalent to
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    function(x, y = 1) x + y
    ```


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nofrills")
```

Alternatively, install the development version from GitHub:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("egnha/nofrills")
```

## Usage

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(nofrills)
```

### Same syntax as `function()` but shorter

```{r}
fn(x ~ x + 1)

fn(x, y ~ x + y)

fn(x, y = 2 ~ x + y)

fn(x, y = 1, ... ~ log(x + y, ...))

# the only exception, cf. alist()
fn(x, ... = , y ~ log(x + y, ...))

fn(~ NA)
```

### Supports quasiquotation

#### Unquoting values

```{r}
z <- 0

fn(x, y = !! z ~ x + y)

fn(x ~ x > !! z)
```

#### Unquoting argument names

```{r}
arg <- "y"

fn(x, !! arg := 0 ~ x + !! as.name(arg))
```

#### Splicing in argument lists

```{r}
args <- alist(x, y = 0)

fn(!!! args, ~ x + y)  # note the one-sided formula
```

### What’s the point of quasiquotation?

Functions in R generally violate a basic tenet of
[functional programming](http://adv-r.hadley.nz/functional-programming.html):
they are [impure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). In simple terms,
this means that the return value of a function will _not_ in general be
determined by the value of its inputs. The reason is that a function’s behavior
can be mutated by changes in its
[lexical scope](http://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#lexical-scoping). This
makes it trickier to reason about your code and ensure that functions do what
you intend.

  - Consider the following function:
    ```{r}
    a <- 1
    foo <- function(x) x + a
    ```
    What is the value of `foo(1)`? It is not necessarily `2` because the value
    of `a` may have changed between the _creation_ of `foo()` and the _calling_
    of `foo(1)`.
    ```{r}
    foo(1)
    
    a <- 0
    
    foo(1)
    ```
    In other words, the value of `foo(x)` does not depend solely on the value of
    `x`, because `foo()` has a “hidden” dependence on the _mutable_ object `a`.
    
`fn()` eliminates such indeterminacy by enabling
[quasiquotation](http://rlang.tidyverse.org/reference/quasiquotation.html).

  - With `fn()`, you can unquote `a` to “burn in” its value at the point of
    creation:
    ```{r}
    a <- 1
    foo <- fn(x ~ x + !! a)
    ```
    Now `foo()` is a pure function, unaffected by changes in its lexical scope:
    ```{r}
    foo(1)
    
    a <- 0
    
    foo(1)
    ```

### 😃 functions

Pop quiz!—These smileys produce functions

```{r, eval = FALSE}
..(~8^D)
..(8~D)
```

but which one is actually callable?

## Alternatives to _nofrills_

Here are some alternative anonymous-function constructors (which don’t support
quasiquotation), ordered by increasing concision and specialization:

  - [`pryr::f()`](https://github.com/hadley/pryr)
  - [`lambda::f()`](https://github.com/jimhester/lambda)
  - [`rlang::as_function()`](http://rlang.tidyverse.org/reference/as_function.html)

## Acknowledgement

The [rlang](https://github.com/tidyverse/rlang) package by [Lionel
Henry](https://github.com/lionel-) and [Hadley 
Wickham](https://github.com/hadley) makes _nofrills_ possible. Crucially, rlang
provides the engine for quasiquotation and expression capture.
