## Overview

_nofrills_ is a lightweight R package that provides `fn()`, a more powerful 
variation of `function()` that:

  - **costs less** — enables tidyverse
    [quasiquotation](http://rlang.tidyverse.org/reference/quasiquotation.html)
    so you don’t pay the price of
    [functional impurity](#why-should-i-care-about-quasiquotation)
    
  - has the **same great taste** — supports a superset of `function()`’s syntax
    and capabilities
    
  - is **less filling** —
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    fn(x, y = 1 ~ x + y)
    
    ..(x, y = 1 ~ x + y)
    ```
    are both equivalent to
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    function(x, y = 1) x + y
    ```


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nofrills")
```

Alternatively, install the development version from GitHub:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("egnha/nofrills")
```

## Usage

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(nofrills)
```

### Same syntax as `function()` but shorter

```{r}
fn(x ~ x + 1)

fn(x, y ~ x + y)

fn(x, y = 2 ~ x + y)

fn(x, y = 1, ... ~ log(x + y, ...))

# the only exception, cf. alist()
fn(x, ... = , y ~ log(x + y, ...))

fn(~ NA)
```

### Supports quasiquotation

#### Unquoting values

```{r}
z <- 0

fn(x, y = !! z ~ x + y)

fn(x ~ x > !! z)
```

#### Unquoting argument names

```{r}
arg <- "y"

fn(x, !! arg := 0 ~ x + !! as.name(arg))
```

#### Splicing in argument lists

```{r}
args <- alist(x, y = 0)

fn(!!! args, ~ x + y)  # note the one-sided formula
```

### 😃 functions

Pop quiz!—These smileys produce functions

```{r, eval = FALSE}
..(~8^D)
..(8~D)
```

but which one is actually callable?

## Why should I care about quasiquotation?

Functions in R are generally
[impure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), i.e., the return value of
a function will _not_ in general be determined by the value of its inputs alone.
This is because a function may depend on mutable objects in its
[lexical scope](http://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#lexical-scoping). Normally
this isn’t an issue. But if you are working interactively and sourcing files
into the global environment, say, it can be tricky to ensure that you
 haven’t unwittingly mutated an object that an earlier function depends upon.

  - Consider the following function:
    ```{r}
    a <- 1
    foo <- function(x) x + a
    ```
    What is the value of `foo(1)`? It is not necessarily `2` because the value
    of `a` may have changed between the _creation_ of `foo()` and the _calling_
    of `foo(1)`:
    ```{r}
    foo(1)
    
    a <- 0
    
    foo(1)
    ```
    In other words, `foo()` is impure because the value of `foo(x)` depends not
    only on the value of `x` but also on the _externally mutable_ value of `a`.
    
`fn()` enables you to write pure functions by using
[quasiquotation](http://rlang.tidyverse.org/reference/quasiquotation.html)
to eliminate such indeterminacy.

  - With `fn()`, you can unquote `a` to “burn in” its value at the point of
    creation:
    ```{r}
    a <- 1
    foo <- fn(x ~ x + !! a)
    ```
    Now `foo()` is a pure function, unaffected by changes in its lexical scope:
    ```{r}
    foo(1)
    
    a <- 0
    
    foo(1)
    ```

## Alternatives to _nofrills_

Here are some alternative anonymous-function constructors (which don’t support
quasiquotation), ordered by increasing concision and specialization:

  - [`pryr::f()`](https://github.com/hadley/pryr)
  - [`lambda::f()`](https://github.com/jimhester/lambda)
  - [`rlang::as_function()`](http://rlang.tidyverse.org/reference/as_function.html)

## Acknowledgement

The [rlang](https://github.com/tidyverse/rlang) package by [Lionel
Henry](https://github.com/lionel-) and [Hadley 
Wickham](https://github.com/hadley) makes _nofrills_ possible. Crucially, rlang
provides the engine for quasiquotation and expression capture.
